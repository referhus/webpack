  "about": "In early 1998, Zemfira moved from her native Ufa to Moscow, where she began working with her band Zemfira on the first studio album released a year later. Since 1999, Zemfira has released six studio albums, which received considerable attention from the press and the public. Her discography also includes a B-side collection and two live albums. Her lyrical quests embodied the spiritual suffering and the search for modern youth. In 1999, the magazine Ogonyok called Zemfira \"the breaking voice of a generation.\" Throughout the singer's career, many of her songs hit the first lines of the music charts in Russia, including Arivederchi, Iskala, Traffic, Walk, We Break, and No Chances.",
